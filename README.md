# `reason-urql` SSR Example

This repository is an example project for showing how to configure [`reason-urql`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/reason-urql) for use with [Next](https://nextjs.org/) to support server side rendering.

The project uses a simple binding to [`next-urql`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/next-urql) to configure the server-side prepass step, which is what executes your queries on the server before your app is sent to the client.
